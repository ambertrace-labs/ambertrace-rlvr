# CLAUDE.md — ambertrace-rlvr

## Overview

`ambertrace-rlvr` is a Python library for **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)** that uses an AmberTrace verified platform as the reward source. It turns a completion into a query, sends it to AmberTrace via the public `ambertraceai` SDK, and converts the returned Amber Report (a `proof_checked` certificate plus confidence and fired rules) into a scalar reward for RL post-training.

The library is a **thin, unopinionated bridge**. It does not implement RL algorithms, host models, or author domains — it wraps existing trainers (TRL/GRPO first) and consumes an existing AmberTrace platform.

**Positioning — this repo is a CUSTOMER of AmberTrace.** It is built strictly against the *public* `ambertraceai` SDK (the one you `pip install`), treated as a black box. No AmberTrace/Pilot source, internal APIs, or private knowledge — if the public SDK can't do something we need, we file an RFC to the platform team (see `docs/rfc-*.md`) rather than reaching inside. If it's not in the published SDK surface, we don't rely on it.

See `docs/` for the full library specification.

### Core pipeline

```
completions ─► CompletionParser ─► AmberVerifier ─► RewardShaper ─► reward
                (text → query,      (ambertraceai     (AmberReport
                 facts)              SDK query)         → scalar)
```

| Stage | Module | Responsibility |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Parse | `parsers.py` | completion text → `ParsedCompletion(query, facts, proposed_answer)`; domain-specific, user-supplied |
| Verify | `verifier.py` | call `platform.query(...)` via `ambertraceai`; batched, async, cached |
| Normalise | `reports.py` | SDK response → `AmberReport` dataclass |
| Score | `rewards.py` | `AmberReport` (+ optional gold) → `RewardBreakdown`; reusable, configurable |
| Adapt | `integrations/*.py` | translate reward shape for TRL / veRL / OpenRLHF; no algorithm logic |

## Design principles

1. **The kernel is the source of truth.** Never re-implement verification. Call the SDK, read the report.
2. **Fail-closed rewards.** A malformed completion, a rejected fact, or an uncertifiable query yields a low (floor) reward — never an exception into the training loop, never a silent pass.
3. **Separate parsing from scoring.** Fact extraction (domain-specific) is decoupled from report→reward (reusable).
4. **Configurable, sane defaults.** A new domain is a config file plus a parser, not a fork.
5. **Reproducible & auditable.** Every reward can emit the underlying Amber Report for inspection.

## Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Use them instead of winging it.

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|------------|
| `/dev-workflow` | Step-by-step feature/fix/refactor flow (understand → ship) |
| `/trace-feature <area>` | Before modifying unfamiliar code — map a path through the pipeline |
| `/tests-create` | After implementation, before running tests |
| `/tests-run` | Before and after review, to verify coverage of changed code |
| `/critical-review` | After tests pass, before pushing |
| `/push-and-pr` | After critical-review returns GO |

## Critical rules

### Never leak proprietary internals

This repo is slated to become **public**. It depends only on the *published* `ambertraceai` SDK surface. It must NOT reference or embed any AmberTrace/Pilot internals: the neurosymbolic kernel design, the underlying platform framework, server architecture/infra, deployment or secret names, internal repo names, or private research docs. If you need an internal detail to proceed, stop and flag it — don't paste it in.

### Fail-closed reward contract

`reward_fn` MUST be safe on a batch, tolerate malformed completions by returning the configured floor, and **never raise into the training loop**. Any exception path (parse failure, SDK error, timeout, rejected fact) resolves to a bounded reward, logged loudly. A crash in the reward function is a bug, always.

### Bounded, monotonic rewards

Every shaper component is bounded to `[0, 1]` before weighting; `total` is clipped to the configured range. Invariant to preserve in tests: a rejected-fact / hallucinated-fact completion must **never out-score** a clean certified one, and malformed input must return the floor.

### No secrets, no PII

- API keys come from env / secret store only; never hardcoded, never logged, redacted from run reports.
- Use **scoped, platform-only** keys in training jobs — never a full-account key.
- Cache keys are hashes of canonicalised facts. No PII in caches or logs. Raw reports persisted only when `debug=true`.

### The library is read-only against AmberTrace

It queries platforms; it never builds, mutates, or authors them. Authoring happens in AmberTrace.

### Type checking

After any Python change, run the type checker (`pyright` or `mypy`, per `pyproject.toml`) and fix all errors. Public API is fully typed — protocols and dataclasses carry annotations.

### Offline-first tests

Tests must not hit the network. Use `FakeVerifier` (in `testing.py`) and recorded/replayed SDK responses (VCR-style) so the suite is deterministic and CI-safe. The opt-in real GRPO integration run is explicitly network-gated and never part of the default suite.

### Git safety

Never `git reset --hard` over unstaged work. Check `git status`, stash if needed. Prefer `git pull --ff-only`, `git revert`, `git branch <name> <sha>`.

## Dependencies

- **`ambertraceai>=1.0.5`** — the public PyPI SDK; the only path to the verifier. Never bypass it or re-implement it. `QueryResult.explanation` is the pinned `QueryExplanation` (dense-reward substrate: `symbolic_trace.rules[]` with `fired`+`required`, `certified_facts`, `certified_fact_summary`, `rejected_facts` `{field,value,reasons}`, `confidence`, `proof`, `schema_version`). As of the 2026-07-10 server deploy the **entire contract is live and dependable** — `schema_version` (`1`), `RuleFiring.required`, `decision.deciding_rules` (on a deny), and structured `rejected_facts` all emit. Gate on `explanation.schema_version`; no field fallbacks needed. Only the throughput asks (`query_batch`, compact `query` projection) remain open — optimisations, not blockers. See `docs/rfc-dense-reward-query-contract.md`. Note the live API may lag the SDK typing — treat `schema_version`, `RuleFiring.required`, structured `rejected_facts`, and `decision.deciding_rules` as **optional** in `reports.py` and degrade to zero-weight when absent (see `docs/rfc-dense-reward-query-contract.md`).
- **TRL** (primary), optionally veRL / OpenRLHF — wrapped by `integrations/`, never modified.
- Model/tokenizer stack per the trainer (e.g. `transformers`).

## Configuration

A run is fully described by a YAML file (`configs/*.yaml`) with `domain`, `reward`, `verifier`, `training`, `dataset`, and `eval` sections. Anything a run needs lives there — no hidden state. See `docs/` §11 for the schema.

## Code style

Match existing conventions. No new patterns without approval.

| Aspect | Convention |
|--------|-----------|
| **Naming** | PascalCase classes, snake_case functions, UPPER_SNAKE constants, `_prefix` private |
| **Imports** | stdlib → third-party → local |
| **Types** | Full annotations on public API; `Protocol` for pluggable seams; `@dataclass` for data contracts |
| **Docstrings** | Minimal — only where non-obvious |
| **Time** | UTC only: `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)` — never `utcnow()` |
| **Errors** | Bounded/fail-closed at the reward boundary; `logger.exception()` in except blocks; never leak keys |
| **Config** | env vars with `.get()` defaults; YAML for run config |
```
